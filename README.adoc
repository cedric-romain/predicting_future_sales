= Predicting Future Sales

== üìà Introduction

Repo for my 5th semester research project

== üìù Planing

Planing is done on a miro board: {miro_link}


== üõ† Set-Up

The environment is managed with https://anaconda.org[conda] and was built on python {python_version}.

The packages are managed using https://python-poetry.org[poetry].

To get started, https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#system-requirements[install conda] and create a new environment and activate it using following code:
[subs="+attributes"]
```
conda create --name {conda_env_name} python={python_version}
conda activate {conda_env_name}
```

Then, begin by installing `poetry`:
```
conda install poetry
```

Finally, navigate to the GitHub repository root folder, then execute following line to install all packages:
```
poetry install
```
